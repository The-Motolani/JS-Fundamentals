# JS-Fundamentals

## 0. [First Constant, First Print](https://github.com/The-Motolani/JS-Fundamentals/blob/main/0-javascript_is_amazing.js)
Week 3 ALX FrontEnd project 0 on JavaScript that involves writing a script that prints “JavaScript is amazing” without the use of *var*

## 1. [3 languages](https://github.com/The-Motolani/JS-Fundamentals/blob/main/1-multi_languages.js)
Week 3 ALX FrontEnd project 1 on JavaScript that requires writing a script that prints 3 lines without the use of `var`

## 2. [Arguments](https://github.com/The-Motolani/JS-Fundamentals/blob/main/2-arguments.js)
Week 3 ALX FrontEnd project 2 on JavaScript that requires writing a script that prints a message dependind on the number of arguments passed without the use of `var` and using [process.argv](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_process_argv) as a reference.

## 3. [Value of my argument](https://github.com/The-Motolani/JS-Fundamentals/blob/main/3-value_argument.js)
Week 3 ALX FrontEnd project on Javascript that requires writing a script that prints the  the first argument passed to it and if no arguments are passed to the script, it print “No argument”, using console.log(...) to print all output and ensuring to avoid the use `var` or *length*.

## 4. [Create a sentence](https://github.com/The-Motolani/JS-Fundamentals/blob/main/4-concat.js)
Week 3 ALX FrontEnd project on Javascript that requires writing a script that prints two arguments passed to it, concantenating with the use of *is* using `console.log(...)` to print all output and ensuring to avoid the use of `var` i.e if two arguments like *C* and *cool* are passed to it, it should return `C is Cool`

## 5. [An Integer](https://github.com/The-Motolani/JS-Fundamentals/blob/main/5-to_integer.js)
Week 3 ALX FrontEnd project on Javascript that requires writing a script that prints `My number: <first argument converted in integer>` if the first argument can be converted to an integer. If the argument can’t be converted to an integer, the script is required to print *Not a number* with the use of `console.log(...)` to print all output ensuring to avoid the use of `var`, `try`, `catch`.

## 6. [Loop to languages]()
Week 3 ALX FrontEnd project on Javascript that requires writing a script that prints 3 lines: (like `1-multi_languages.js`) but by using an array of string and a loop.
The first line: *"C is fun"*
The second line: *“Python is cool”*
The third line: *“JavaScript is amazing”*
Using `console.log(...)` to print all output, making sure to avoid the use of `var`, `if/else statement`, and using only one `console.log` and the use of a loop either `for`loop or `while` loop but i opted for the use of the `for` loop.

## 7. [I love C](https://github.com/The-Motolani/JS-Fundamentals/blob/main/7-multi_c.js)
Week 3 ALX FrontEnd project on Javascript that requires writing a script that prints `x` times *“C is fun”*
Where `x` is the first argument of the script
If the first argument can’t be converted to an integer, print “Missing number of occurrences”
making sure to use only 2`console.log(...)` to print all output and a loop (while, for, etc.) and avoiding the use of `var`. I opted for the use of the `if` loop.

## 8. [Square]()
Week 3 ALX FrontEnd project on Javascript that requires writing a script that prints a square ensuring the first argument is the size of the square and checking if the first argument can’t be converted to an integer, it prints “Missing size” and using the character X to print the square. 
Making sure to use `console.log(...)` to print all output and a loop (while, for, etc.) avoiding the use of `var`.
